## Installation
Requires node.js to be installed. Then the included package.json works with `npm install`
## Usage
Use `node server` to create an instance of the server, and then use a browser to view `localhost:8080`.  
You can view the current table status and make a booking for a table.  
The first 5 bookings recieved will be given a table, any bookings after that will be put on the wait list.  
The submission form will make an alert to let you know if you have to wait for a table.
